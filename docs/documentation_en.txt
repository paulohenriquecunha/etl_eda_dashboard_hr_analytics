# DOCUMENTATION — HR Analytics Portfolio

1. Project Overview
   The project investigates employee turnover using a simulated HR dataset (IBM/Kaggle).
   The goal is to identify risk profiles, analyze associated factors, and estimate the financial cost of turnover.

2. Data Description
- Source: HR dataset (simulated).
- Size: 1,470 employees, with 237 attritions.
- Main variables: age, monthly salary, years at the company, department, job role, overtime, satisfaction indices.
- Observations: no missing values. Outliers were inspected via IQR and kept, as they represent valid cases (high salaries, long careers).

3. Methodology
- **ETL & Cleaning**: column renaming (to PT), creation of derived variables (age ranges, tenure ranges, salary quartiles).
- **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**: histograms, turnover rates by segment, correlation analysis (point-biserial).
- **Comparisons**: salary and satisfaction (stayed vs. left).
- **Financial Calculation**: turnover cost = annual salary of attritions × replacement rate (30–70%, standard 50%).
-  **Tools**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Power BI.

4. Key Results
- Turnover rate: 16.1% (237/1470).
- By department: Sales (20.6%), HR (19%), R\&D (13.8%).
- By age: ≤25 (35.8%) vs 36–45 (9.2%).
- By tenure: ≤1 year (34.9%) vs ≥10 years (8.1%).
- Overtime: 30.5% (Yes) vs 10.4% (No).
- Salary: low (29.3%) vs high (10.3%).
- Average monthly salary: \$4,787 (left) vs \$6,832 (stayed).
- Satisfaction consistently lower among attritions.
- Estimated turnover cost: \$6.8 million.
- Potential savings: \$1.02 million (15% reduction with market benchmarks: SHRM, Gallup, Deloitte).

5. Insights and Conclusions
- Turnover is not random: it concentrates among young employees, low salary, short tenure, and those working overtime.
- Low satisfaction and low salaries reinforce attrition risk.
- Sales and HR are priority areas for retention policies.
- The financial impact is significant and requires targeted actions.

6. Recommendations
- Structured onboarding (reduce exits within the 1st year).
- Career plans and promotion opportunities.
- Salary review to reduce inequalities.
- Overtime management to avoid overload.
- Engagement programs (work environment, feedback, recognition).

7. Study Limitations
- Dataset is simulated (not real).
- Qualitative aspects may not capture actual behavioral factors.
- Correlations are weak (<0.20), indicating that turnover is multifactorial.
